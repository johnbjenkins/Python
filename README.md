# Python
Projects and exercises demonstrating Python learning

These are examples of Python competency gained during study. 
File names decribe the learning outcome of the model contained within.

Where the file name does not describe the Python learning outcome, such as "911 Calls Data Analysis Project"
or "Financial Data Analysis Project", these are capstone projects amalgamating a number of skills learned up
to that point.

All coding carried out in Jupyter Notebook.
